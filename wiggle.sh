# wiggle.sh: Optimizes parameters of a program.
#
# Given a command to run a program with its parameters, that simultaniously returns a number which is to be maximized,
# wiggle.sh parses the integer and float numbers of those parameters and continues to run the command with those
# new variations until a local maximum is achieved.

# run the command

# if it doesnt return a number, exit with error

# split the command by spaces

# find the indices of numbers

# tweak the indices and iterate through the possibilities

# keep the best result and continue unless stagnation

exit 0;
